## Case Study 
Flutter Mobile App with Real-Time WebSocket Integration

## Objective
To build a simple Flutter mobile app that consumes a WebSocket (`wss://eth-mainnet.ws.alchemyapi.io/ws/demo`) and demonstrates effective state management to display real-time data on a dedicated page.

## Requirements
### 1. WebSocket Integration
- Integrate the WebSocket connection with wss://eth-mainnet.ws.alchemyapi.io/ws/demo. (https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/using-websockets/)
- Subscribe to `alchemy_newFullPendingTransactions`
- Establish a secure and reliable connection to receive real-time data.

### 2.  State Management:
-  Choose and implement a state management solution that suits the requirements.
-  Demonstrate the ability to handle and update the app's state based on incoming WebSocket data.
### 3. Real-Time Data Display:
-  Create a dedicated page within the app to display real-time data.
-  Implement a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI for data representation.
-  Ensure that the data updates seamlessly as new information is received through the WebSocket.
### 4. User Interface:
-  Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the mobile app.
-  Include necessary components for user interaction and feedback.
-  Consider best practices for mobile app UI/UX design.
### 5. Error Handling:
-  Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms for WebSocket connection issues.
-  Ensure that the app provides meaningful error messages to users in case of connection problems.
### 6. Testing:
-  Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of the WebSocket integration and state management.
-  Perform testing to ensure that the app works correctly on various devices and screen sizes.
### 7. Code Quality:
-  Follow Flutter best practices and guidelines for coding standards.
-  Use modular and maintainable code structure.
-  Consider code readability, reusability, and scalability.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Successful integration of the WebSocket connection.
- Effective implementation of a state management solution.
- Real-time data display on a dedicated page with a well-designed UI.
- Proper error handling for WebSocket connection issues.
- Adherence to Flutter coding standards and best practices.
